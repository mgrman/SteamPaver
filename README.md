Create Windows 10 tiles for Steam Games

**This Application allows you to create Windows 10 tiles for Steam games.**

First it downloads a list of your games using your SteamCommunity ID.
Then it downloads the default game image from Steam and lets you crop it and make a tile from it.
It is using the default Steam url for launching games, but wraps it in a script file so it can use VisualManifest to add a tile image to it.
